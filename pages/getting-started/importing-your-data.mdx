# Importing your data

## Importing subscribers

If you import a large number of subscribers, I'll temporarily disable your account so Buttondown can review the imported emails and make sure they're all up to code. The process shouldn't take more than a few hours!

Navigate to your [settings page](https://buttondown.email/settings) and click _Import subscribers!_ You'll be prompted to upload a CSV:

Once you do so, you can map each column in your CSV, allowing you to bring in subscribers while keeping their existing tags, join dates, and metadata.

## Importing archives

Navigate to your [settings page](https://buttondown.email/settings) and choose the appropriate service! (If you don't see the service you're looking for, just go ahead and [email me](https://buttondown.email/settings) â€” I'd be more than happy to migrate them for you!)

## FAQs

### Wait, what's a CSV?

Great question! A CSV is a comma-separated values file. It's a plain text file that contains a list of values separated by commas. You can open it in any text editor, and it's easy to create and edit.

Most online applications like Excel or Google Sheets have a way to export your data as a CSV. Here's an example of how to do this in Google Sheets:

If you're not sure how to do this, just [email me](mailto:justin@buttondown.email) and I'll help you out!

### I'm importing my subscribers from another newsletter service. Do they have to confirm their email address again?

Assuming that the subscribers have _already consented_ to receiving email (via double-opt-in or some other mechanism provided by your previous subscriber), no! GDPR-wise, their existing consent carries over to Buttondown.

### Adding a listserv?

Be sure that folks on the listserv are expecting the subscription: if one of them clicks to unsubscribe from the newsletter, it will affect the entire listserv (since from Buttondown's perspective, the listserv is a single subscriber.)
